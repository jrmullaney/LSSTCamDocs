The camera file
===============

To be able to process your data, the stack needs to know a number of things about the physical properties of your camera. For example, it needs to know how many pixels are on the CCD(s), whether it has an overscan region that needs trimming, what the saturation limit is (so it can mask saturated sources), etc.
